test.sh is a naive script that: 
- creates an SB-enabled VM with /boot partition
  - custom SB key already enrolled
  - /etc/pki/pesign db with said key
- installs fedora38-- change that by editing virt-install command
- installs packages needed for signing, etc.
- installs a new kernel according to repo in install_fedora.ks (currently
  Robbie's kernel-6.3.0-0.rc2.89f5349e0673.24.test.fc38)
- implements naive boot logging scheme using systemd target
- signs new kernel and reboots into it
- gets correct config files from etc/ and 99grub2-emu/
- builds nmbl using dracut command
- allows user to boot using nmbl

This has been tested on hypervisors in Beaker, and seems to be relatively
robust. It's important to tar xhf this entire directory and then scp the
tar archive in order to preserve symlinks which point to other directories
in this repo.

Once you extract the tar archive simply ./test.sh name_of_vm to execute.
