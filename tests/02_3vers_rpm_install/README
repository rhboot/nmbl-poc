test.sh is a naive script that: 
- creates an SB-enabled VM with /boot partition
  - custom SB key already enrolled
  - /etc/pki/pesign db with said key
- installs fedora38-- change that by editing virt-install command
- installs packages needed for signing, etc.
- installs and signs two new kernels according to repo in install_fedora.ks
- implements naive boot logging scheme using systemd target: log is
/var/log/entry_booted.txt
- installs nmbl built with 6.3.0 kernel
- signs all three ukis and creates efi boot entries for them
- sets BootNext to nmbl (megalith)
- allows user to boot using nmbl
- user can optionally use the measure_reboot command to capture time needed
to reboot

It's important to tar xhf the entire tests directory and then scp the
tar archive in order to preserve symlinks which point to other directories
in this repo and have the necessary files to perform VM installation, etc.

Once you extract the tar archive simply ./test.sh name_of_vm to execute.
