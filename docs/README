install.ks is a kickstart file that can be used to automate installation.
It also creates repos with a new grub build (2.06-89.f38) and Robbie's test
kernel (6.3.0...) 
Use with virt-command to completely automate installation. You have to be
logged-in (kerberos) for this to work because it uses internal repos.

Once you have your machine, run the auto.sh script to transfer the files you
need onto it, and then ssh there.

Run the scripts in order. 
s1 will prompt you for a passwd for your cert, and
after it runs, you need to reboot the machine and enroll the certificate.

After running s2, you can reboot into the new kernel to make sure that
everything is working as expected.

s3 and s4 are separate scripts for no good reason. Deal with it. :)
